Scope: This seminar is devoted to geometric structures on manifolds, and
their topological properties. We are particularly interested in (almost)
complex manifolds, symplectic topology and geometry, (almost) Kahler geometry,
and spin^c geometry, as well as the tools of algebraic topology and geometric analysis that have proven useful
in studying such structures. The goal is expose faculty and students to present day research and foundational material in a relaxed format that includes traditional lectures with an
actively engaged audience.

          1/30: Prof. Sisi Shen (City Tech, CUNY)
          <br>   <i> Title: The continuity equation for Hermitian metrics     
          </i>
        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>:  Initially introduced by La Nave-Tian, the continuity equation is an elliptic analogue to the K\"ahler-Ricci flow which serves as an alternative way of tackling the Analytic Minimal Model program. Sherman-Weinkove generalized this work to the Hermitian setting, providing an elliptic analogue to the Chern-Ricci flow. We will discuss the behavior of solutions to the continuity equation on Hopf and Inoue surfaces as well as Oeljeklaus-Toma manifolds and compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of this approach. In addition, we will discuss some new results on coupled continuity equations that can be used to study the cscK problem.

          2/13: Prof. Kuan-Hui Lee (McGill University)
          <br>   <i> Title: The stability of steady generalized Ricci solitons  
          </i>
        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>:  Non-Kähler Calabi-Yau theory is a newly developed subject, and it arises naturally in mathematical physics and generalized geometry. The relevant geometries are pluriclosed metrics which are critical points of the generalized Einstein–Hilbert action which is an extension of Perelman’s F-functional. In this talk, we studied the non-Kähler Calabi-Yau through pluriclosed flow which was first introduced by Streets and Tian a few years ago. We study the critical points of the generalized Einstein-Hilbert action and discuss the stability of critical points which are defined as pluriclosed steady solitons. We proved that all compact Bismut–Hermitian–Einstein metrics are linearly stable.

          2/27: Prof. Manuel Rivera (Purdue U.)
          <br>   <i> Title: String topology via the coHochschild complex   
          </i>
        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>:  I will describe a tractable chain-level model for the free loop space of a simplicial complex. The construction is based on coHochschild homology theory for coalgebras and does not assume any restrictions on the fundamental group or the commutative ring of coefficients. 

I will then describe a way of lifting Poincaré duality to the chain level by adapting the formalism of Pre-Calabi Yau structures (developed independently by Tradler/Zeinalian and Kontsevich/Takeda/Vlassopoulos) to our setting. 

Combining the two ingredientes above we produce algebraic formulae for string topology of (possibly non-simply connected) homology manifolds. From these formulae one can observe that assuming locality conditions on the  chain-level lift of Poincare duality are necessary to recover the loop coproduct, an operation that can distinguish homotopy equivalent non-homeomorphic manifolds. This is joint work with Alex Takeda.

          3/6: Prof. David Pham (CUNY)
          <br>   <i> Title: Twists, Codazzi Tensors, and the 6-sphere
          </i>
        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>:  Starting with an almost Hermitian manifold (M,g,J,\omega) and an automorphism \psi of TM, one can "twist" the existing structure to obtain a new almost Hermitian structure in a rather natural way.  In this talk, we will examine these \psi-twisted almost Hermitian structures with particular emphasis on questions regarding the integrability of the twisted almost complex structure J^\psi and the Riemannian geometry of the twisted metric g^\psi.  By studying the latter, we identity a certain class of automorphisms of the tangent bundle with nice transformation properties.  We call these automorphisms g-Codazzi maps because of their close relationship with Codazzi tensors.  The aforementioned results are ultimately applied to the standard nearly Kahler structure on the 6-sphere where we prove a nonintegrability result for the class of g-Codazzi maps.

          </i>
        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>:  We show that the normalized Kahler-Ricci flow on a compact Kahler manifold with semiample canonical bundle converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to the metric completion of the twisted Kahler-Einstein metric on the canonical model, as conjectured by Song-Tian. This is based on joint work with Man-Chun Lee and Valentino Tosatti.
