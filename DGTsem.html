Scope: This seminar is devoted to geometric structures on manifolds, and
their topological properties. We are particularly interested in (almost)
complex manifolds, symplectic topology and geometry, (almost) Kahler geometry,
and spin^c geometry, as well as the tools of algebraic topology and geometric analysis that have proven useful
in studying such structures. The goal is expose faculty and students to present day research and foundational material in a relaxed format that includes traditional lectures with an
actively engaged audience.

        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>: We study the geometries associated to various 3-forms on a symplectic 6-manifold of different orbital types. As an application, we demonstrate how this can be used to find Lagrangian foliations and other geometric structures of interest arising from certain degeneration of Calabi-Yau 3-folds.

        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>: In this talk, we discuss some properties of HKT (hyperkahler with torsion) balanced manifolds. First, we will study the Lie algebra of hyperholomorphic vector fields on such manifolds. Then, we will prove a deformation result, namely we prove that the HKT balanced condition is an open condition in the HKT cone. This is a joint work with Giovanni Gentili.

        <a>Abstract</a>: :  In 1987 Gromov and Thurston developed the first Riemannian manifolds that are not homotopy equivalent to a hyperbolic manifold but admit a Riemannian metric that is ϵ-pinched for any given ϵ>0. The manifolds that they construct are branched covers of hyperbolic manifolds, and to construct the metric they perform a sort of "geometric surgery" about the ramification locus. In 2022 Stover and Toledo proved the existence of similar branched cover manifolds built out of complex hyperbolic manifolds, and via a result of Zheng these manifolds admit a negatively curved Kahler metric. In this talk we will discuss how to construct a (not Kahler) Riemanain metric on these Stover-Toledo manifolds which is ϵ-close to being 1/4-pinched for any prescribed ϵ>0.

          <br>   <i> Title: Distinguishing between singular symplectic quotients using invariant theory.                                                                                                                                         
          </i>
        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>: Given a Hamiltonian action of a compact Lie group on a symplectic manifold with equivariant moment map, the Marsden-Weinstein symplectic quotient is defined to be the quotient of the zero-fiber of the moment map by the group action. In this case, zero is assumed to be a regular value of the moment map so that the zero-fiber is a manifold on which the group acts freely and properly. When zero is not a regular value, the zero-fiber of the moment map is no longer a manifold, and its quotient by the group action is a singular space. By the results of Sjamaar-Lerman, such a singular symplectic quotient has the structure of a symplectic stratified space, a disjoint union of smooth symplectic manifolds, as well as a Poisson algebra of smooth functions.

	      The local structure of a singular symplectic quotient can be understood by considering the case of a unitary representation of a compact Lie group, thought of as a real symplectic vector space. In this case, there is a unique homogeneous quadratic moment map for which zero is generally a singular value. There are many examples of non-isomorphic groups and representations that yield singular symplectic quotients that are symplectomorphic via a symplectomorphism that preserves their algebraic structures. We will discuss the use of the polynomial invariants of the representation and topological methods to study the smooth structures of symplectic quotients, identify symplectomorphic examples, and distinguish between non-symplectomorphic cases.
