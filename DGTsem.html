Scope: This seminar is devoted to geometric structures on manifolds, and
their topological properties. We are particularly interested in (almost)
complex manifolds, symplectic topology and geometry, (almost) Kahler geometry,
and spin^c geometry, as well as the tools of algebraic topology and geometric analysis that have proven useful
in studying such structures. The goal is expose faculty and students to present day research and foundational material in a relaxed format that includes traditional lectures with an
actively engaged audience.

          <br>   <i> Title: Hypercomplex Geometry and Compact Lie groups        
          </i>
        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>: In the early 1950s, Samelson and Wang (working independently) both showed that every even dimensional compact Lie group admits a left-invariant complex structure.  Hypercomplex geometry necessarily requires the dimension of the manifold to be a multiple of 4.  Motivated by the work of Samelson and Wang, it is natural to conjecture that every compact Lie group of dimension 4n admits a left-invariant hypercomplex structure.  Dominic Joyce, in the early 1990s, showed that (at the very least) if G is any compact Lie group, then GxT always admits a left-invariant hypercomplex structure where T is a torus of sufficient size.  Interestingly, there are examples in the recent literature that assert that Joyce’ s theorem implies that the aforementioned conjecture is true. In this talk, we show that the conjecture is actually false.  More precisely, we show that the Lie group SU(2)^m never admits a left-invariant hypercomplex structure for all m>0.  (In particular, this is true for the non-trivial case m=4n.)

          <br>   <i> Title:   Explicit complete Calabi-Yau metrics and Kähler-Ricci solitons.                                                             
                                                                                           
          </i>
        </h4>
        <a>Abstract</a>: Since Calabi's original paper, the Calabi Ansatz has been central for constructions in Kähler geometry. Calabi himself used it to construct complete Ricci-flat metrics on the total space of the canonical bundle of a Kähler-Einstein Fano manifold B, generalizing some well-known examples coming from physics. Over the years, work of Koiso, Cao, Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf, Futaki-Wang, Chi Li, and others have shown that the Calabi Ansatz can be used to produce complete Kähler-Ricci solitons, important singularity models for the Kähler-Ricci flow, on certain line bundles over B. In this talk, I'll explain a generalization of these results to the total space of some higher-rank direct-sum vector bundles over B. In our case the Calabi Ansatz is not suitable, and we instead use the theory of hamiltonian 2-forms, introduced by Apostolov-Calderbank-Gauduchon-Tønneson-Friedman. The construction produces new examples of complete shrinkers, steadies, and Calabi-Yau metrics, as well as recovering some known ones.

        <a>Abstract</a>: In this talk, we will consider the asymptotic Dirichlet problem 
for harmonic maps from the product $\mathbb{H}^{m_1} \times \mathbb{H}^{m_2}$ of two hyperbolic spaces 
to hyperbolic spaces. 
It remarks that $\mathbb{H}^{m_1} \times \mathbb{H}^{m_2}$ is a higher rank symmetric space of noncompact type. 
We first show uniqueness and non-existence results, particularly the existence of such harmonic maps (with some natural conditions) 
implies that it must be $m _1 = m_2 = 2$. 
We also show an existence result for harmonic maps from $\mathbb{H}^2 \times \mathbb{H}^2$ 
to hyperbolic spaces. 
This is a joint work with Yoshihiko Matsumoto.

        <a>Abstract</a>: Pluriclosed flow is a Hermitian curvature flow introduced by Streets and Tian in 2010 which preserves the pluriclosed condition along the flow. I will discuss some joint work with Mario Garcia-Fernandez and Jeff Streets using the framework of generalized complex geometry, as introduced by Hitchin and Gualtieri in the early '00s, to obtain some results on long-time existence and convergence for the flow and obstructions to the existence of Bismut-Ricci flat metrics. If there is time, I will discuss some more recent work with Hao Fang solving a related problem on a class of generalized Kahler surfaces.

        <a>Abstract</a>: To a holomorphic vector bundle $E \to X$ with Hermitian metric $\mathfrak{h}$ over a complex $n$-manifold $X$ one can associated its so-called 
	 $\textit{Bergman space}$:
\[
\mathscr{H} (\mathfrak{h}) := \left \{ f \in H^0(X, \mathcal{O} _X(K_X \otimes E)) \ ;\ \int _X |f|^2_{\mathfrak{h}} < +\infty \right \}.
\]
A smooth holomorphic family of Hermitian vector bundles thus yields a family of Hilbert spaces.   This family of Hilbert spaces is similar to a holomorphic vector bundle in certain ways, but need not be locally trivial.  Nevertheless, one can associate to such an object a notion of curvature which recovers the curvature of the Chern connection of the $L^2$ metric when the family of Hilbert spaces is a holomorphic Hilbert bundle.  In this talk we shall focus on the case in which the holomorphic family of complex manifolds is smooth, proper and K\"ahler.  We shall explain this construction, prove a positivity-of-curvature theorem, and discuss some of its consequences.

        <a>Abstract</a>: I will survey the construction of some explicit manifolds with nontrivial triple and quadruple Massey products. Particularly notable is a recent example of a 6-dimensional symplectic manifold that does not admit a Kahler structure, due the presence of a nontrivial quadruple Massey product. With a view towards understanding the naturality of higher Massey products in the category of A-infinity algebras, I'll also give a gentle introduction to A-infinity structures and A-infinity morphisms, and indicate how these low order Massey products are understood in this formalism. This is preparatory material for ongoing work with Kate Poirier and Thomas Tradler.

        <a>Abstract</a>:
In 1954, Samelson showed that every even dimensional compact Lie group admits a left-
invariant integrable almost complex structure. Almost simultaneously, Wang found
sufficient and necessary conditions for when an even dimensional homogenous manifold
admits an invariant integrable almost complex structure. In this talk, we
present some recent applications of Samelson’s construction in the setting of SKT geometry. 
Specifically, we construct a family of left-invariant SKT metrics on the exceptional Lie group G2
 where G2 is equipped with a Samelson complex structure.  This work is motivated by a 2023 paper of Fino
and Grantcharov where (among other things) they carried out a similar calculation for the Lie
group SO(9). In addition, we also show that Samelson’s construction can be suitably modified to 
yield a left-invariant integrable almost complex structure on the tangent Lie group of any compact Lie group
(odd or even dimensional).  We then move from Lie groups to the more general setting of homogeneous
reductive manifolds which are equipped with invariant complex structures.  We review the correspondence between
invariant structures on homogeneous manifolds and their counterparts at the Lie algebra level. We give a 
number of actual examples of homogeneous Hermitian manifolds (both Kahler and non-Kahler). We then consider the 
problem of calculating and extracting  information from the curvature of Gauduchon connections on a homogeneous 
Hermitian manifold.  This part of the talk is a work in progress.

        <a>Abstract</a>: In 1980, M. L. Michelsohn developed a kind of "Clifford Cohomology" on Kaehler manifolds. She defined a bi-grading of the complexified Clifford bundle and an operator on sections respecting the bigrading that squares to 0. She then showed that the cohomology obtained is isomorphic to the usual Dolbeault cohomology.

Continuing the work started with Sam Hosmer years ago, I have been trying to do something similar but relaxing the Kaehler condition. I finally found an elliptic, self-adjoint operator based on the Dirac operator, that respects the Clifford bigrading. Although this operator does not square to 0, it has other interesting properties.

I will explain in detail the setup of the theory and prove the main results, as well as welcome suggestions and ideas from the participants.

        <a>Abstract</a>: Any hyperkaehler manifold contains entire curves as shown by Verbitsky using ergodicity, i.e., hyperkaehler manifolds are Kobayashi non-hyperbolic. More generally, together with S. Lu and Verbitsky (and later, with C. Lehn in the singular case) we have established the Kobayashi conjectures in cases of Lagrangian fibrations, i.e., that the Kobayashi pseudometric vanishes identically. In particular, this applies to all known examples of compact hyperkaehler manifolds. For Lagrangian fibrations with no multiple fibers in codimension one, we also have holomorphic dominability results with S. Lu, that imply the existence of a Zariski dense entire curve on a hyperkaehler manifold admitting such a Lagrangian fibration.
